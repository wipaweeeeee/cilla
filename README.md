# cilla
A repo for cilla<br>
cilla can now run her simple python program that will give her a random phrase to use as a starting point for her daily creative sketch. It is not meant to be a literal translation or strict rule but rather a silly spark so that cilla can free herself from senses and move into the non-senses. <br>

For cilla to use, cilla needs to run "python cilla.py" in terminal and proceed to http://127.0.0.1:5000/<br>
