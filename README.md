# cilla
A repo for cilla<br>
cilla can now run her simple python program that will spit out random phrase to use as a starting point for her daily creative sketch. It is not meant to be a literal translation or strict rule but rather a silly spark so that cilla can free herself from senses and move into the non-senses. <br><br>

For cilla to use, run "python cilla.py" <br>

Next step for me is to create a simple Flask app so that the page will look nicer for cilla, the designer.
